# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purposea
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes

```
1.Members
   Name
   Contact number
   Address
2.Programs
   Type
   Duration
   Fees
3.Trainers
   Name
   Specialization
   Contact number
4.Payments
   Amount
   Payment Type
   Due Date
```

### Relationships and Constraints

```
1.Members — Joins → Programs
2.A member joins one or more programs.
3.Programs — Conducts → Trainers
4.Trainers conduct programs.
5.Trainers — Duty → Payments
6.Payments are associated with trainers’ duties.
```

### Assumptions
```
1.Every user must register as a member before accessing gym services.
2.A member has a unique contact number.
3.Each session or class is led by exactly one trainer.
4.Trainers can conduct multiple sessions but not at overlapping times.
```

# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

**Business Context:**  
The Central Library wants to manage book lending and cultural events.

**Requirements:**  
- Members borrow books, with loan and return dates tracked.  
- Each book has title, author, and category.  
- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

### Entities and Attributes

```
1.MEMBER
   memb_id(PK)
   memb_name
   contact no.
   date
2.LOAN
   loan_date
   due_date
   return_date
   fine
   memb_id(FK)
   book_id(FK)
   loan_id(PK)
3.BOOK
   Title
   Author
   Category
   book_id(PK)
4.Event
   event_id(PK)
   event_name
   event_date
   room_id(FK)
5.Speaker
   speaker_id(PK)
   name
6.Room
   room_id(PK)
   room_name
   capacity
   purpose
```

### Relationships and Constraints
```
1.Member ↔ Loan ↔ Book
   A Member can borrow many Books (M:N, resolved via Loan).
   Each Loan relates one Member to one Book.
2.Member ↔ Event
   A Member can register for many Events.
   An Event can have many Members.
   M:N → resolved via Event_Registration.
3.Room ↔ Speaker
   A Room can have multiple Speakers.
4.Event ↔ Room
   Each Event occurs in exactly one Room (1:N).
 ```  
### Assumptions
```
1.A member must be registered before borrowing books or registering for events.
2.Member contact number is unique.
3.Each loan refers to a single book and a single member.
4.Loan must have both a loan date and due date.
5.Every book belongs to exactly one category
```

# Scenario C: Restaurant Table Reservation & Ordering

**Business Context:**  
A popular restaurant wants to manage reservations, orders, and billing.

**Requirements:**  
- Customers can reserve tables or walk in.  
- Each reservation includes date, time, and number of guests.  
- Customers place food orders linked to reservations.  
- Each order contains multiple dishes; dishes belong to categories (starter, main, dessert).
